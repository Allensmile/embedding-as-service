To do
1. Download all pretrained Models for Fasttext,word2vec and GLOVE - https://developer.syn.co.in/tutorial/bot/oscova/pretrained-vectors.html
2. Build end to end working model for all embeddings with mean, max, hierarchical pooling.

3. Will set one default model for each embedding.
4. User will have the option for specifying their trained model path.
5. Make a function to create embedding matrix.
6. add functionality for sentence similarity.
7. add bin file for fasttext
